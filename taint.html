<img height="100" src="./images/taint.png" /> <h1>The Unholy Order of Tainthood</h1>
			<p>
			For those that wish to join the ranks of the Cavalry, those we want to party with, or those that wish to
				simply camp with us on a regular
			basis, we now have a process to join us. This used to be the rank of the quarterhorse, but the quarterhorse
			morphed into something else. So we replaced the original intent of the quarterhorse with something new. This
				award taint a swordhose, and taint a quarterhorse, but is completly different... and absolutely amazing.
			</p>
			<p>
			Instead of a unanimous vote from the household. To join this order, you merely need the support of one
			member of the Cavalry. Any fully qualified Sword Horse can be your sponsor into the Order
			of the Taint. This means we like you, we want to hang out with you, and we want you to continue to have
			fun with us. Possibly we even want you to join our ranks in the future.
			</p>
			<h3>SYMBOL OF TAINTHOOD</h3>
			<p>
				You are free to fly the symbol of this order everywhere you possibly can.
				The symbol is not the Sword Horse symbol, but it is similar. It is two white crosses, crossed upon a red field. Any resemblance of this image to the asshole
				of a horse is completely coincidental.
			</p>

			<h3>ORDER DETAILS</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The process of joining is called being "Canonized a Taint"</li>
				<li>Every taint requires a "Patron Taint" Sword Horse member to sponsor you</li>
				<li>You must be over the age of 21 and be able to participate in communion. Where once a night at wet sites
					you drink the blood of Fritz. (Take a shot with the other taints)</li>
				<li>You choose a religious title upon joining. (Paladin, Cleric, Heathen, Which Doctor, etc...)</li>
				<li>Upon joining your patron taint may bestow upon you a holy symbol. (Which is typically a mug)</li>
				<li>During the initiation ceremony, the prospect is baptized in alcohol by their patron taint and from
					then on is no longer considered clean and is considered tainted.</li>
				<li>We reserve the right to excummunicate anyone acting like a douchbage.</li>
			</ul>


			<h3>RULES OF THE UNHOLY ORDER OF THE TAINT</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Thou shalt not be a dick.</li>
				<li>Thou shalt not be an asshole.</li>
				<li>Thou shalt always lie in between.</li>
				<li>** Also, any bishop hats that are worn must be in the shape of a penis. **</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>ROLE OF A PATRON TAINT</h3>
			<p>
			Upon becoming a patron taint, the sword horse member is required to help you on your pilgrimage.
			Whether it be to join the household, or simply camp with us they will help. The member can also choose to be the patron
			taint of something that does not have a patron taint already. All taints and members are free to have fun with this. Regardless if this person is
			your personal patron taint or not. The symbolism is allowed, so have fun with it.
			</p><p>
			For example, this common prayer could be said by anyone...<br />
			Oh Fritz, patron taint of dice, please do not curse my roll in this game of tablero.
			</p>
